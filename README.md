Open source my dumb little game I worked on way too much time. It is my first Unity project, it is not pro in any way, but it is

A. not an asset flip

B. playable from start to finish

Also with Achievements on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2999220/Cupigs_Key_Collectathon/

Or you know: you build it from this, I do not care I am just happy I am done with it.

The whole game took me about two years to make (meaning I sat down from time to time to do things in it, I did not measure the actual time put in, but it is not much). It started out as a simple "you touch a platfomr it disaoears labyrinth where you have to touch all platform" and grown in to this game with the pig. The code has more platform types I did not bother to put in to levels. Also nothing was pallenned in advance and it shows. I really just wanted to make and stick with a project from zero to Steam release.
